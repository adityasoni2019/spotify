Okay, so, I'm completely changing the scope of the project here.

I'm going to make it exactly like exportify. but, I'm not going to go through there code base. 

Why am I doing this?

1. clear mind of where to head.
2. Knowing that it's possible. 
3. The thing I wanted, is prolly not going to work in the first place, cause, Spotify doesn't give dev accounts for crack email ids. And, I'll need one. Or maybe it'll work. And, if this thing (exportify) works, I'll see if I can make the initial idea work as well.
